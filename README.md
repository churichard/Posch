Posch
=====

Posch, which is an amalgamation of Positive Challenge, is an Android app that encourages people to spread positivity and do good deeds. By challenging the user to do just one good thing every day, the user is both compelled by the low barrier to entry and intrigued by the different acts that the app offers for him/her to do. Posch was created in the hopes that the kindness it fosters will help the world become a better and kinder place.

Happy posching!
